CS432 - Interactive Computer Graphics - Winter 2008
Final Project

For my final project, I have written an interactive maze game. The program
simulates a three dimensional maze inside a building structure containing a
series of hallways. The object of the game will be to find the way to the exit.

The maze is generated by treating the maze as a tree and visiting nodes in the
tree via a random recursive depth-first traversal.  Each cell (room) in the maze
is treated as a node in the tree, while each of the unvisited neighboring cells 
act as children of that node.  The algorithm starts from the goal cell and
continues until it has visited all of the cells in the maze, knocking down walls
as it travels between cells.  For more information on this, and several other
maze generation algorithms, see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation>.

Textures were obtained from the following locations:
Walls - <http://www.filterforge.com/filters/5129.html>
Ceiling - <http://www.filterforge.com/filters/4756.html>
Floor - <http://www.filterforge.com/filters/4351-v3.html>

NOTE: The included Makefile will compile the program on Mac OSX, but because of
the way OSX handles mouse movement and cursor hiding, controlling the game
with the mouse may be difficult and/or frustrating.  If this is the case, please
use the keyboard to control the game instead (see key bindings section below).

The game is tested and known to work on the following systems:
Gentoo Linux with nVidia GeForce 6200 (NV44A)
Ubuntu Linux (CS Lab machines)
Mac OSX 10.4.11 with Intel GMA 950 (Intel Mac Mini)


key bindings
============

movement
--------
w - move forward
a - strafe left
s - move backward
